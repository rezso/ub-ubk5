This application uses parts of qtkeychain (https://github.com/frankosterfeld/qtkeychain), icons frome the breeze theme (https://github.com/KDE/breeze-icons) and of course Qt (https://www.qt.io/). This software wouldn't be the way it is without all the people behind those projects, so a large contribution goes to them of course, even though they aren't directly involved with this software. Thank you very much, everyone!
