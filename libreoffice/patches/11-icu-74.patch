 #         Line Breaking Rules

+#         Implement default line breaking as defined by
+#         Unicode Standard Annex #14 (https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/)
+#         for Unicode 14.0, with the following modification:
+#
+#         Boundaries between hyphens and following letters are suppressed when
+#         there is a boundary preceding the hyphen. See rule 20.9
+#
+#         This corresponds to CSS line-break=strict (BCP47 -u-lb-strict).
+#         It sets characters of class CJ to behave like NS.
 
 #
 #  Character Classes defined by TR 14.

-#
-#  !!lookAheadHardBreak    Described here because it is (as yet) undocumented elsewhere
-#                          and only used for the line break rules.
-#
-#           It is used in the implementation of the incredibly annoying rule LB 10
-#           which says to treat any combining mark that is not attached to a base
-#           character as if it were of class AL  (alphabetic).
-#
-#           The problem occurs in the reverse rules.
-#
-#           Consider a sequence like, with correct breaks as shown
-#               LF  ID  CM  AL  AL
-#                  ^       ^       ^
-#           Then consider the sequence without the initial ID (ideographic)
-#                 LF  CM  AL  AL
-#                    ^           ^
-#           Our CM, which in the first example was attached to the ideograph,
-#           is now unattached, becomes an alpha, and joins in with the other
-#           alphas.
-#
-#           When iterating forwards, these sequences do not present any problems
-#           When iterating backwards, we need to look ahead when encountering
-#           a CM to see whether it attaches to something further on or not.
-#           (Look-ahead in a reverse rule is looking towards the start)
-#
-#           If the CM is unattached, we need to force a break.
-#
-#           !!lookAheadHardBreak forces the run time state machine to
-#           stop immediately when a look ahead rule ( '/' operator) matches,
-#           and set the match position to that of the look-ahead operator,
-#           no matter what other rules may be in play at the time.
-#
-#           See rule LB 19 for an example.
